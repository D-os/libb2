Note, the error text that gets printed when you
have bad arguments is wrong.  There is little to
no helpful debugging information printed, and
if you don't follow these guidelines, undefined
things happen.


These are the usages:


To get dependencies:

idlc --deps --output OUTPUTDIR IDLFILE

Note, the files printed as depenencies are not
the correct files for dependencies.  I'm checking
it in incorrect so that Steven can put it into
BOBS.


To generate-o-rama:

idlc INCLUDES [--system] [--output DIR] IDLFILE

INCLUDES is zero or more of:
	-I<includedir>
There is no space between the I.
The current directory is implicitly in the list.
This might change.  Specify full path names here
for best results.

[--system]
Optional.  Causes it to generate system headers
(i.e. uses '<' and '>' for #includes and prepends
a '_' to the header guards.

[--output DIR]
Save generated files in the directory DIR.
It's optional, but you should use it.  CWD is used
otherwise.

IDLFILE
The name of the file to process.  It should end with
.idl, although idlc shouldn't bork if it doesn't. 
Currently, it might bork.


The following files are created in the output directory:

If the idl file is XXX.idl

If you're generating dependencies, the file is "IXXX.d"
If you're generating-o-rama the files are "IXXX.h" and "IXXX.cpp"
