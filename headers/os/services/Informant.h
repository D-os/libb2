/*!	A class that lets you notify others when something happens.  This is to
	replace sublaunching.  The basic idea here is that a service can subclass
	BInformant, and call Inform() when something needs broadcasting.  Clients
	use the IInformant interface to register for events.  They can notified
	by having a method called on an already existing object (RegisterForCallback())
	or by having a component object created, and then having a particular method
	called on that newly created object (RegisterForCreation()).

		@param target The object on which to call the supplied method.
		@param method The method that will be called on your object when the key is pushed.  The method is expressed as an SValue key, which will be a method if the target object is an interface, or it will be passed as the key parameter to Observed if target is a BObserver.

		See the descriptions in RegisterForCallback for the key, method, flags and cookie parameters.

		@param key The key for which to register.  Each subclass of BInformant will most likely push different keys.
		@param context The context to use when your component is created.  Get this from the Root() method on your context, or use get_default_context() if you're in protein land and you don't need elevated security privileges.
		@param process The process in which to create your component.  If you pass NULL, a new process will be created just for you.  Careful, this might be slow if your key is pushed a lot.  WARNING: This passing NULL to get a new process is not yet implemented yet.  If you do this, the component will currently end up in the same process as the service.
		@param component The component name to instantiate, for example com.palmsource.apps.Address.Listener
		@param interface The interface to inspect to on your object.
		@param method The method that will be called on your object when the key is pushed.  The method is expressed as an SValue key, which will be a method if the target object is an interface, or it will be passed as the key parameter to Observed if target is a BObserver.
		@param flags The flags to apply.  Currently unused, defaults to 0.
		@param cookie An SValue you will receive back when your method is called.
