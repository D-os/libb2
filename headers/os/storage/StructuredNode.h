//!	An INode containing a fixed set of named entries.
/*!
	BStructuredNode is a convenience class that helps you expose data
	as a node.  You'll want to use this class if you want a node
	with a fixed set of entries, where @e you supply the data (unlike
	BCatalog, which allocates and manages the data for each entry
	itself).

	To use this convenience class, make a subclass of it.  Into the
	constructor, pass an array of strings for the names of the entries
	and the count of those strings.  You must
	guarantee that those c-strings exist for the lifetime of your
	object.  A common way to do that is to make them static global
	constants, and to include an SPackageSptr in your subclass.  That
	technique will keep your library loaded (and therefore the strings
	around) as long as one of your objects exists.

	To return data from the class, implement ValueAtLocked().  If your
	data can be changed, you can optionally implement StoreValueAtLocked().
	These APIs operate in terms of indices into your name array.

	Via BBIndexedDataNode (and its base classes, BMetaDataNode,
	BIndexedIterable, and SIndexedDatumGenerator), BStructuredNode takes
	care of generating IDatums as needed, managing IIterators, and the
	rest of the functionality needed to participate in the @ref BinderDataModel.
	You can override various other methods of those classes to further
	customize the behavior of your node, and use BGenericNode::SetMimeType()
	to customize the MIME type of your node.
