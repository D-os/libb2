/*!	Don't use this unless you have a good reason to do
	so.  Most threading needs can be served by sending messages
	to a BHandler, which (a) is easier to use; (b) consumes much
	less resources; (c) more flexible; and (d) will probably let
	you avoid some amount of pain down the road.  However, if
	you've really absolutely gotta have your own thread, here it
	is.  Have fun.
