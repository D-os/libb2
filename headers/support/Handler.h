/*----------------------------------------------------------------*/
/*----- SHandler class --------------------------------------------*/

//!	SHandler is an event queue to deliver and process SMessage objects.
/*!	The SHandler is a base class for executing
	asynchronous operations and/or performing serialization of those
	operations.  It is a mechanism for implementing concurrency.

	SHandler provides a set of posting methods for placing SMessage
	data into an execution queue. Each message in the queue is timestamped,
	and the messages in the queue are consecutively
	processed by SHandler in their timestamped order.

	Message delivery is asynchronous: your thread can return from
	delivering a message before the message has even started execution.
	However, to ensure the correct delivery order of the messages, the
	handler only processes one at a time.

	Messages are sent to a SHandler by calling one of PostMessage(),
	PostMessageAtTime(), PostDelayedMessage(), or
	EnqueueMessage().  You subclass from SHandler and override
	HandleMessage() to process messages that have been posted to the handler.

	SHandler can also be used to serialize with external operations.
	To do this, pass in an external lock to the constructor.  This
	lock will then be acquired when calling HandleMessage.  In this way,
	the serialization of SHandler message handling can be also
	synchronized with external operations.

	See @ref SHandlerPatterns for many examples of threading
	techniques you can use with SHandler.
