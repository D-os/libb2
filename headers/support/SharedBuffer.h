	To correctly use the class, you will usually keep a const SSharedBuffer*
	to your buffer, and call Edit() when you would like to modify its data.
	This ensures you follow the correct copy-on-write semantics, not allowing
	you to modify a buffer if it has more than one user.

	\note Because you do not own this memory, you can not place anything
	in it for which you must do some cleanup when freeing its memory.
	(For example, the memory can not contain pointer to binders or any
	other SAtom-derived class, which will need a Release() call when the
	shared buffer it is in goes away.)
