// Data Member Documentation:
//
// The "fBenaphoreCount" member is set to 1 if the BLocker style is
// semaphore.  If the style is benaphore, it is initialized to 0 and
// is incremented atomically when it is acquired, decremented when it
// is released.  By setting the benaphore count to 1 when the style is
// semaphore, the benaphore effectively becomes a semaphore.  I was able
// to determine this is what Be's implementation does by testing the
// result of the CountLockRequests() member.
//
// The "fSemaphoreID" member holds the sem_id returned from create_sem()
// when the BLocker is constructed.  It is used to acquire and release
// the lock regardless of the lock style (semaphore or benaphore).
//
// The "fLockOwner" member holds the thread_id of the thread which
// currently holds the lock.  If no thread holds the lock, it is set to
// B_ERROR.
//
// The "fRecursiveCount" member holds a count of the number of times the
// thread holding the lock has acquired the lock without a matching unlock.
// It is basically the number of times the thread must call Unlock() before
// the lock can be acquired by a different thread.

            // increment the counter and acquire the lock.  The second will
            // acquire the semaphore and therefore the lock.  Not good.

            // This has been discussed on the becodetalk mailing list and
            // Trey from Be had this to say:
            //
            // I looked at the LockWithTimeout() code, and it does not have
            // _this_ (ie the race condition) problem.  It circumvents it by
            // NOT doing the atomic_add(&count, -1) if the semaphore
            // acquisition fails.  This means that if a
            // BLocker::LockWithTimeout() times out, all other Lock*() attempts
            // turn into guaranteed semaphore grabs, _with_ the overhead of a
            // (now) useless atomic_add().
            //
            // Given Trey's comments, it looks like Be took the same approach
            // I did.  The output of CountLockRequests() of Be's implementation
            // confirms Trey's comments also.
            //
            // Finally some thoughts for the future with this code:
            //   - If 2^31 timeouts occur on a 32-bit machine (ie today),
            //     the benaphore count will wrap to a negative number.  This
            //     would have unknown consequences on the ability of the BLocker
            //     to continue to function.
            //
        }
    }

    // If the lock has successfully been acquired.
    if (status == B_OK) {
        // Set the lock owner to this thread and increment the recursive count
        // by one.  The recursive count is incremented because one more Unlock()
        // is now required to release the lock (ie, 0 => 1, 1 => 2 etc).
        fLockOwner = find_thread(NULL);
        fRecursiveCount++;
