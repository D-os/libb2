 * This binder condition variable implements the following
 * methods: Wait, Open, Close and Broadcast, just like
 * SConditionVariable, except that there is no Wait that
 * takes a SLocker, and that it is implemented with a
 * scripting interface.  So it will work across processes
 * but will do an IPC to lock and unlock, so don't do it,
 * because you will suck up lots of resources and waste a
 * lot of time.
