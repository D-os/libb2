Coding Style
============

Own code follows Google C++ Style Guide
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
(SIC! Adroid Utils and Binder code deviates.)

BeAPI compatibility layer follows Be Headers of course.
OpenBinder code stays as it is in line with Google Style.

Why?
- CapitalisedMethodNames help distinguish from memberVariables
- we no need no m_ember prefixes
- CAPS_IDENTIFIER_NAMES are so ingrained that we may as well leave them



sudo chmod 0666 /dev/binder /dev/kmsg ; sudo sysctl -q kernel.printk_devkmsg=on; bins/servicemanager/servicemanager

Android's PersistableBundle is a lot like BeOS BMessage. Can work as a mutable replacement for SValue.
(OpenBinder SMessage is _nothing_ like BMessage)

Attaching to ShellInterface will give you stdin/stdout/stderr file descriptors, that are not
byte streams, but packet socket(2)s of unix(7) domain type DGRAM.
Or maybe just connect()/accept() one socket of SOCK_SEQPACKET type?
Protocol is undetermined, but shell sends PersistableBundle (or MsgPack?) of form [type, payload].
