Coding Style
============

Own code follows Google C++ Style Guide
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
(SIC! Adroid Utils and Binder code deviates.)

BeAPI compatibility layer follows Be Headers of course.
OpenBinder code stays as it is in line with Google Style.

Why?
- CapitalisedMethodNames help distinguish from memberVariables
- we no need no m_ember prefixes
- CAPS_IDENTIFIER_NAMES are so ingrained that we may as well leave them
